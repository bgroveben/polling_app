## Python and Django  
### This tutorial will make a basic polling application  

This project is ripped from the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/).

I am using Python version 3.5.1 and Django version 1.9.7

I am finished for now, but this project could use a bit more testing and some thorough documentation.

I moved the 'polls' directory to the 'django-polls' app for packaging; it can be installed/uninstalled with pip.

Get this thing up and running by opening the terminal, going to the root directory and:

1.  =>  python3 manage.py runserver  
2.  Open your browser to [localhost:8000/polls/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/)  
OR  
[localhost:8000/admin](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/)  
username: admin  
password: djangoadmin
