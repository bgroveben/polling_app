## Python and Django  
### This tutorial will make a basic polling application  

This project is ripped from the [Django tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial01/).

I am using Python version 3.5.1 and Django version 1.9.7

I am [here](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.9/intro/tutorial02/).

I got this thing up and running by going to the root directory and:  
1. => python3 manage.py runserver  
2. Open your browser to localhost:8000/polls/ (that's the only view I have up right now)
